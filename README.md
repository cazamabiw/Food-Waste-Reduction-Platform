# Food Waste Reduction Platform (FWRP)

## Introduction
The Food Waste Reduction Platform (FWRP) targets the global food waste issue through the use of technology to encourage collaboration among users along the food supply chain. Its main goal is to enhance sustainability and decrease food waste by supporting the effective allocation of surplus food. The FWRP provides a user-friendly interface for food shops to monitor inventory, identify surplus commodities, and list them for donation or sale at a discount. Charitable groups may simply claim surplus food products offered by stores, ensuring that food is distributed to those in need. Furthermore, consumers may buy leftover food items at lower costs, helping to prevent food waste while giving inexpensive solutions for people.
